                    <p>From the very beginning, our mission for VideoCC has been simple: to provide a powerful, intuitive, and completely free tool for creators. We built it out of a personal need for a better workflow, and we've been thrilled to see how many of you have found it just as useful. Today, we want to talk about a small change we're making to ensure we can continue to support and grow this platform for years to come.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Why We're Introducing Ads</h2>
                    <p>Keeping a web service running involves costs—from hosting and domain fees to the time we invest in developing new features and fixing bugs. To help cover these expenses and support the project's future, we've decided to integrate Google AdSense into the site.</p>
                    <p>This was a decision we considered carefully. We wanted to find a way to support the site that aligns with our core mission of keeping the tool accessible to everyone, without putting essential features behind a paywall.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Our Commitment to Your Experience</h2>
                    <p>Our top priority is, and always will be, your workflow. We are committed to ensuring that these ads are as unobtrusive as possible. They are implemented in a way that should not interfere with the core functionality of the captioning and bookmarking process. You can find more details about our data handling in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
                    <p>Simply by continuing to use VideoCC, you're helping us. There is absolutely no pressure to click on any ads. Your presence on the site alone helps demonstrate its value and contributes to its sustainability.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for being a part of this journey. Your feedback and support are what drive us to make VideoCC better every day. We're excited to continue building the best free captioning tool on the web, and this small step will help us do just that.</p>
