                    <p>Here at VideoCC, we're obsessed with workflow and efficiency. Our <strong>Global Autofill</strong> feature is a cornerstone of that obsession, designed to learn from your past work across all videos to speed up repetitive typing.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Bug: An Annoying Echo</h2>
                    <p>Some of our eagle-eyed users noticed that when typing in a bookmark or subtitle field, the Global Autofill would sometimes suggest the <em>exact text they were already typing</em>. This happened because the system was saving your input on every keystroke, and then reading that fresh input as a potential suggestion for itself. Instead of helping, it was just creating a distracting echo.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Fix: Making Autofill Non-Self-Referential</h2>
                    <p>Today, we pushed a fix that completely resolves this issue. We've re-engineered the logic to be much smarter. Now, when you start typing, the <code>showSuggestions</code> function identifies the specific bookmark you are currently editing and <strong>explicitly excludes it from the suggestion pool</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In simple terms, the autofill system can no longer see what you're currently typing. It only looks at <em>other</em> previously completed notes, whether from the current video or any other video you've worked on.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Result: Cleaner, Faster Suggestions</h2>
                    <p>This fix means every suggestion you see is now a relevant, helpful piece of information from your past work, never a redundant echo of your current input. This makes for a cleaner, faster, and more intuitive annotation experience, letting you focus on the content without distractions.</p>
                    <p>We're always working to refine the tools you use every day. Thanks for your feedback, and happy captioning!</p>
